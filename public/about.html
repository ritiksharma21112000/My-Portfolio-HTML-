My journey into technology began with a diploma in Chemical Engineering. Realizing my true calling was in tech, I dove headfirst into web development and software engineering.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m focusing on mastering the full stack to become a versatile developer capable of handling projects from end to end. My projects showcase my interests in web and mobile app development, IoT, and cloud computing. I am actively documenting my journey on LinkedIn, sharing insights and progress weekly, as I cover technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, and Node.js.</p>

<p>I’ve also worked on hands-on projects, such as a Smart Irrigation System for optimized water usage and an Alcohol Detection System that highlights my problem-solving approach and technical abilities. Additionally, my recent design work on the Recruit CRM assessment project focused on enhancing user experience, where I revamped the admin settings page for greater usability and improved the sourcing extension’s interface.</p>

My goal is to secure a high-impact role within the industry, leveraging my expertise in full-stack development, my dedication to problem-solving, and my drive to make meaningful contributions to the tech world.</p>
